# Description 
The visualization explores tourist attractions in New York City, categorizing them by type and representing them on a map. Design choices were made to ensure clarity, expressiveness, and contextual relevance. The consistent use of red color for general attractions, regardless of subtype, provides a cohesive and easily recognizable visual identity for all tourist destinations. Icons such as paw prints for animals or zoos and paintbrushes for artworks were chosen to enhance visual appeal and aid in quickly identifying attraction types. The person-walking icon is employed for viewpoints and other entertainment attractions, adding a clear distinction to these points of interest. Additionally, the dharmachakra icon represents the wonder wheel of New York, contributing to a more nuanced and informative visual language. The use of blue for public transport and grey for hotels, along with clustering markers to prevent map clutter, ensures a balanced and user-friendly representation of tourist attractions. Tooltips and popups offer additional details without overwhelming the map, creating a visually pleasing and informative exploration of New York City's tourist hotspots.
