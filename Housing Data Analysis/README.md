# Exploring Housing Data: A Support Vector Analysis of the IPUMS Housing Data
This project explores the application of Support Vector Machines (SVM) in predicting
homeownership using demographic and economic data. SVM is a machine learning algorithm
that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. The project discusses the kernel functions, and tuning parameters of SVM. The findings
suggest that age of person, number of bedrooms in the house, cost of water and number of
rooms are strong predictors of homeownership. The project also includes a plot of the SVM
decision boundary to visualize the classifier's performance on two strong predictor variables.
The implications of the findings are discussed in the context of current societal challenges
surrounding access to housing, and suggestions are made for policymakers. This project
demonstrates the potential of SVM in predicting homeownership and provides insights into the
factors that influence homeownership.
