# NYC Flights Departure Delays Analysis

## Project Structure
The project is structured into different sections, each focusing on a specific factor affecting departure delays. The report is designed for a non-technical audience and includes visualizations and tables to illustrate key findings. The analysis includes hypothesis testing, specifically permutation tests, to support conclusions.

## 1. Time of Day Analysis
### Findings:
- Average departure delays increase with the progression of the day.
- Permutation test confirms a significant difference in departure delays between morning and evening hours.

## 2. Time of Year Analysis
### Findings:
- Average departure delays vary with different seasons.
- Permutation tests reveal significant differences in departure delays between summer and other seasons.

## 3. Temperature Analysis
### Findings:
- Departure delays show an increasing trend with higher temperatures.
- Permutation test supports the conclusion that departure delays are higher at temperatures above 50 degrees.

## 4. Wind Speed Analysis
### Findings:
- No significant evidence found to suggest a relationship between wind speed and departure delays.

## 5. Precipitation Analysis
### Findings:
- Higher precipitation values correlate with increased departure delays.
- Permutation test supports the conclusion of a significant difference in departure delays with high precipitation.

## 6. Visibility Analysis
### Findings:
- Lower visibility values are associated with higher departure delays.
- Permutation test confirms a significant difference in departure delays between low and high visibility conditions.

## 7. Conclusion
The analysis reveals various factors influencing departure delays for United Airlines. Time of day, time of year, temperature, precipitation, and visibility all exhibit a noticeable impact on departure delays. Wind speed, however, does not show a significant relationship with delays. The results provide valuable insights for improving efficiency and customer satisfaction at United Airlines.

## 8. Appendix
The code used for the analysis is included in the appendix, clearly labeled to correspond with each section of the main report. This ensures transparency and allows for a deeper understanding of the analysis process.
