# NYC Flights Departure Delays Analysis for United Airlines (UA)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing departure delays specifically for United Airlines (carrier code UA) using data from the nycflights13 package. The objective is to understand the relationship between departure delays and various factors, including time of day, time of year, temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and visibility, specifically for UA flights.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into different sections, each examining the impact of a specific factor on departure delays for UA flights. The report is tailored for a non-technical audience and includes visualizations and tables to illustrate key findings. The analysis incorporates hypothesis testing, particularly permutation tests, to support conclusions.

## 1. Time of Day Analysis
### Findings:
- Average departure delays for UA flights increase throughout the day.
- Permutation test confirms a significant difference in departure delays between morning and evening hours for UA flights.

## 2. Time of Year Analysis
### Findings:
- UA flights experience variations in average departure delays based on different seasons.
- Permutation tests reveal significant differences in departure delays between summer and other seasons for UA flights.

## 3. Temperature Analysis
### Findings:
- Departure delays for UA flights show an increasing trend with higher temperatures.
- Permutation test supports the conclusion that departure delays are higher at temperatures above 50 degrees for UA flights.

## 4. Wind Speed Analysis
### Findings:
- No significant evidence found to suggest a relationship between wind speed and departure delays for UA flights.

## 5. Precipitation Analysis
### Findings:
- Higher precipitation values correlate with increased departure delays for UA flights.
- Permutation test supports the conclusion of a significant difference in departure delays with high precipitation for UA flights.

## 6. Visibility Analysis
### Findings:
- Lower visibility values are associated with higher departure delays for UA flights.
- Permutation test confirms a significant difference in departure delays between low and high visibility conditions for UA flights.

## 7. Conclusion
The analysis specifically tailored for United Airlines reveals key factors influencing departure delays. Time of day, time of year, temperature, precipitation, and visibility all play a role in UA flight delays. However, wind speed does not show a significant relationship with departure delays. The insights gained from this analysis can aid UA in improving efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## 8. Appendix
The code used for the analysis, tailored for UA flights, is included in the appendix. Each section of the code is clearly labeled to correspond with the main report, ensuring transparency and facilitating a deeper understanding of the analysis process for UA flights.
