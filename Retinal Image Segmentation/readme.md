This project explores the application of deep learning techniques for automated blood vessel segmentation in retinal images. The primary objective was to develop and evaluate a U-Net convolutional neural network model to accurately identify blood vessels within retinal fundus images. Using the well-established DRIVE dataset, the project involved image preprocessing, data augmentation, model training, and performance evaluation.
